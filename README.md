# 🧠 OSEP Scripting & Red Team Automation Toolkit

> Personal repository of custom scripts, payload generators, stagers, automation tools, and AV-evasion utilities developed during my journey through the **OSEP (Offensive Security Experienced Penetration Tester)** certification and advanced red team practice labs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo centralizes my personal tooling for:

- Practicing and automating **PEN-300 (OSEP)** attack techniques
- Developing **custom stagers, payloads, and evasive droppers**
- Experimenting with **code execution, Active Directory abuse, lateral movement, and C2** delivery
- Building a reusable, modular toolkit for real-world red team assessments
